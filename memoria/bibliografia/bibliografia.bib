abstract = {Social networks constitute a valuable source for documenting heritage constitution processes or obtaining a real-time snapshot of a cultural heritage research topic. Many heritage researchers use social networks as a social thermometer to study these processes, creating, for this purpose, collections that constitute born-digital archives potentially reusable, searchable, and of interest to other researchers or citizens. However, retrieval and archiving techniques used in social networks within heritage studies are still semi-manual, being a time-consuming task and hindering the reproducibility, evaluation, and open-up of the collections created. By combining Information Retrieval strategies with emerging archival techniques, some of these weaknesses can be left behind. Specifically, pooling is a well-known Information Retrieval method to extract a sample of documents from an entire document set (posts in case of social network’s information), obtaining the most complete and unbiased set of relevant documents on a given topic. Using this approach, researchers could create a reference collection while avoiding annotating the entire corpus of documents or posts retrieved. This is especially useful in social media due to the large number of topics treated by the same user or in the same thread or post. We present a platform for applying pooling strategies combined with expert judgment to create cultural heritage reference collections from social networks in a customisable, reproducible, documented, and shareable way. The platform is validated by building a reference collection from a social network about the recent attacks on patrimonial entities motivated by anti-racist protests. This reference collection and the results obtained from its preliminary study are available for use. This real application has allowed us to validate the platform and the pooling strategies for creating reference collections in heritage studies from social networks.},

abstract = {It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content. One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans. Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers.},

abstract = {Author profiling is the identification of demographic features of an author by examining his written text. Recently, it has attracted the attention of research community due to it’s potential applications in forensic, security, marketing, fake profiles identification on online social networking sites, capturing sender of harassing messages etc. We need benchmark corpora to develop and evaluate techniques for author profiling. Majority of the existing corpora are for English and other European languages but not for under–resourced South Asian languages, like Roman Urdu (written using English alphabets). Roman Urdu is used in daily communication by a large number of native speakers of Urdu around the world particularly in Facebook posts/comments, Twitter tweets, blogs, chat blogs and SMS messaging. The construction of sentences of Urdu while using alphabets of English transforms the language properties of the text. We aim to investigate the behavior of existing author profiling techniques for multilingual text consisting of English and Roman Urdu, concretely for gender and age identification. We here focus on author profiling on Facebook by (i) developing a multilingual (Roman Urdu and English) corpus, (ii) manually building of a bilingual dictionary for translating Roman Urdu words into English, (iii) modeling existing state-of-the-art author profiling techniques by using content based features (word and character N–grams) and 64 different stylistic based features (11 lexical word based features, 47 lexical character based features and 6 vocabulary richness measures) for age and gender identification on multilingual and translated corpora, (iv) evaluating and comparing the behavior of above mentioned techniques on multilingual and translated corpora. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that (i) existing author profiling techniques can be used for multilingual text (Roman Urdu + English) as well as monolingual text (corpus obtained after translating multilingual corpus using bilingual dictionary), (ii) content based methods outperform stylistic based methods for both gender and age identification task and (iii) translation of multilingual corpus to monolingual text does not improve results.}

Therefore, large amounts of self-assessed data on MBTI are readily available on social-media platforms such as Twitter. We present a novel corpus of tweets annotated with the MBTI personality type and gender of their author for six Western European languages (Dutch, German, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish). We outline the corpus creation and annotation, show statistics of the obtained data distributions and present first baselines on Myers-Briggs personality profiling and gender prediction for all six languages.",

ABSTRACT={Objective: Despite a long history of interest in personality traits and psychosis, the association between personality traits and psychotic experiences in the general population is not yet well understood. One possible factor that could influence the degree of distress from psychotic experiences is emotion regulation. The purpose of this study was to explore whether the association between personality and psychotic symptoms is already apparent in non-clinical youth as well as the mediating role of emotion regulation strategies between personality traits and psychotic experiences.Methods: Three thousand one hundred and forty seven college students were surveyed via self-report questionnaires measuring the Five-Factor model of personality, emotion regulation strategies, and psychotic experiences.Results: Neuroticism was found to be significantly positively correlated with psychotic experiences, while Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness were found to be significantly negatively correlated. Both the suppression and reappraisal strategies mediated the relationship between personality traits and psychotic experiences.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that youth with certain personality traits are more likely to have psychotic experiences. The reappraisal emotion regulation strategy could serve as a protective factor against the distress of psychotic experiences.}

We present our approach to gender identification in Twitter performed on the tweet corpus provided by CLEF for the task. Our approach takes advantage of textual information solely, and consists of tweet preprocessing, feature con- struction, dimensionality reduction using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and classification model construction. We propose a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, with different types of word and character n-grams as features. Our model was the best-performing model in textual classification, with the ac- curacy of 0.8221, 0.82, and 0.809 on the English, Spanish, and Arabic datasets respectively. Considering the combination of textual and image classification, and all three datasets, our model ranked second in the task.},

    abstract={The Author Profiling (AP) task aims to distinguish between groups of authors labeled by a common demographic characteristic such as gender or age by studying the language usage. In this work we studied the role of personal phrases (i.e., sentences containing first person pronouns) for the AP task. We support the idea that people better expose their personal interests and writing style when they talk about themselves and, consequently, that words near to a personal pronoun reveal valuable information for the classification of authors. The evaluation using different social media data showed that phrases containing singular first person pronouns are highly valuable for predicting the age and gender of users. Considering only these phrases we obtained reductions of up to 60 % of the information in the user documents and a comparable classification performance than using all available data. In addition, the results obtained by personal phrases considerably outperformed those from non-personal sentences, indicating their greater suitability for the AP task. We consider these findings could be further applied in the design of strategies for the construction of AP corpora, novel feature selection methods, as well as new feature and instance weighting schemes.},
